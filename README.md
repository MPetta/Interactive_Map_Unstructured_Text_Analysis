# Interactive_Map_Unstructured_Text_Analysis
Used here is a Kaggle dataset comprised of approximately 40,000 recipes from 20 different cuisines. To supplemnet to recipes dataset, I downloaded demographic and economic data grouped by country and joined this with the initial dataset. The full dataset contained approximately 6,700 unique ingredients with a total count of all ingredients around 428,000. The data was processed to provide the top five most frequent ingredients per cuisine. After processing the unstructured recipes an interactive map was made in Python. The map serves to provide insight into cuisine types. An R-Shiny version was also made for comparison.
